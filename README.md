<h1>Resimulation of Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) in Python</h1>  

In this project, we explore the nuances of Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), illustrating how simulated environments can enhance this critical safety feature. By leveraging resimulation, we can efficiently iterate, test, and validate the system without relying solely on real-world driving tests. This approach accelerates development while ensuring safety and robustness in a controlled environment.
